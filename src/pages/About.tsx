      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I’m a Frontend Developer with three years of experience, working mainly with e-commerce and CDNs like WordPress. I work with PHP, Laravel, and modern frameworks like Vue (Quasar) and React. Within the WordPress ecosystem, I have experience with Elementor, WooCommerce, multilingual support, among others

I enjoy challenges that help me grow, whether working independently or as part of a team. I’ve worked with international teams, collaborating directly with clients from Spain, which broadened my experience and perspective.</p>
